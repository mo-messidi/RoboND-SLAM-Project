# RoboND-SLAM-Project
A Showcase of GraphSLAM using the RTAB-Map package in ROS

## 
This prject showcases a successfully implementation of robot SLAM using the GraphSLAM algorithm. A robot, custom bot,
was made to autonomously map two simulation environments unknown to it and localize itself accurately in each of self-constructed
maps. The project was developed using ROS. The ROS package RTAB-Map was used to implement the GraphSLAM algorithm and
visualize the robot generated maps and gazebo was used to simulate the robot and its environments.
